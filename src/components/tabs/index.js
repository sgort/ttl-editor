// Export all tab components from a single location
// This allows importing like: import { ChangelogTab, ServiceTab } from "./components/tabs"

export { default as ChangelogTab } from "./ChangelogTab";
export { default as ServiceTab } from "./ServiceTab";
export { default as OrganizationTab } from "./OrganizationTab";
export { default as LegalTab } from "./LegalTab";

// Future tab exports (uncomment as they are created):
// export { default as RulesTab } from "./RulesTab";
// export { default as ParametersTab } from "./ParametersTab";
// export { default as PreviewTab } from "./PreviewTab";
