// Writes this repository's release SBOM to docs/sbom/, in CycloneDX.
//
// ICTU recommendation 10 asks for SBOMs of released versions, kept analysable:
// a new advisory lands against code that shipped months ago, and answering
// "was that version affected?" needs the bill of materials as it was THEN.
// Workflow artifacts expire after 90 days on a public repository, so the
// committed copy is the durable one; .github/workflows/sbom.yml uploads the
// same document as an artifact for a promotion.
//
// Production dependencies only (--omit=dev): the question an SBOM answers here
// is what the released artifact contains, and devDependencies are not in it.
// The full tree is three times the size and is what `npm audit` already walks
// daily, on both branches.
//
// --package-lock-only, so this needs no install and describes the lockfile
// rather than whatever happens to be in node_modules.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/write-sbom.mjs            write docs/sbom/<name>-<version>.cdx.json
//   node scripts/write-sbom.mjs --check    exit 1 if that file is missing or stale
