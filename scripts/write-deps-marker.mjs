// Snapshots package-lock.json into node_modules right after a successful
// install, so scripts/check-deps.sh can later ask "does the lockfile on disk
// still match what was actually installed?" by comparing content rather than
// file mtimes. `git checkout` and `git merge --ff-only` rewrite tracked files
// even when their content is unchanged, so an mtime says nothing about whether
// dependencies moved.
//
// Node, not bash. This runs as the "postinstall" script. Until
// sgort/linked-data-explorer#119 that included the Static Web Apps build, where
// Oryx ran `npm install` inside the action's own container, which has no shell
// this repository can rely on. Both deploy workflows now build on the runner
// with skip_app_build, so that no longer applies; Node stays because it is the
// one runtime every install is guaranteed to have.
