# Compares the lockfile against the snapshot scripts/write-deps-marker.mjs
# (the "postinstall" script) takes after every install, ignoring this
# repository's OWN version number.
#
# A byte comparison is not enough: every release bump rewrites the `version` at
# the top of package-lock.json and in its root package entry (the "" key), so a
# byte comparison would refuse to start the dev server after every release even
# though no dependency had changed. Those fields describe what we publish, not
# what is installed. Third-party entries (every key containing `node_modules/`)
# keep their `version`, and the root entry keeps its dependency lists, so
# upgrading or adding a package still counts as a change.
#
# Parsing the JSON also makes line endings irrelevant.
#
# The same check runs in ronl-business-api and linked-data-explorer.
#
# Exit codes: 0 in sync, 1 dependencies differ, 2 a file could not be read.
